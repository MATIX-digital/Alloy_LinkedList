Hi everyone,

I would like to share my linked list implementation for temporal logic with you. Maybe someone can use it for himself, develop it further or improve it.
It supports basic list functions.

The number of checks can be expanded ;).

One problem with the current implementation is that a list cannot contain the same object twice. A possible solution can be found in the comments of the code. 

For my use case the list worked great like this.
